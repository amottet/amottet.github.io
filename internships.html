        <p>Constraint satisfaction problems are decision problems of the form "Given a set of variables, a set, and constraints over the variables, does there exist a map from the variables to the domain that satisfies all the constraints?"
          Such problems are parameterized by the set of constraints that are allowed in the input, called the <em>constraint language</em>.
          For constraint languages consisting of relations on a finite set, the complexity of problems has been completely characterized by a celebrated recent result by Bulatov and Zhuk: every CSP is either in P or NP-complete, and the border between the two cases can be characterized algebraically using tools from the theory of universal algebra.<br />
            The following contains possible topics for a bachelor or a master thesis on the topic of constraint satisfaction problems and their generalizations.

          Recently, some extension was proposed by Barto, DeMeo, and Mottet, where constraint languages with relations and operations were considered.
          A similar dichotomy P vs. NP-complete result was obtained for constraints over a two-element set, but the problem for general finite sets remains wide open.
        
        
        <h3>Goals</h3>
            The goal of the internship is to develop the existing methods and prove complexity dichotomies for larger classes of constraint languages, in particular in the 3-element case.
          The tools that will be employed are mathematical in nature, leveraging the theory of universal algebras.
            
        <ul>
            <li>Bachelor: read and write a report on [1] and [2]; compute an example of a structure with 3 elements that is not covered by the result in [2] and investigate the complexity of its CSP.</li>
            <li>Master: read [1] and [2], investigate a complexity dichotomy for the CSPs of all 3-element structures.</li>
        </ul>
            
            Another possible goal is to implement the algorithm described in Reference [2].

        <p>Reference [1] looks at the topological complexity of possible solution sets for instances of CSP($\mathbb A$), where $\mathbb A$ is a two-element structures.<br />
            In more details, with every solution set of an instance $I$ one can associate a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubical_complex">cubical complex</a> (like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplicial_complex">simplicial complex</a> but where faces are generalizations of squares and cubes).<br />
        A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semialgebraic_set">semi-algebraic set</a> is a subset of $\mathbb R^d$ that is a union of sets defined by polynomial equalities and inequalities.<br />
        The authors prove that Pol($\mathbb A$) is the clone of projections iff for every compact semi-algebraic set $S$, there exists an instance of CSP($\mathbb A$) whose associated cubical complex is homeomorphic to $S$.</p>
        
        <h3>Goal</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>Bachelor: read [1] and write a report on it with full proofs and prerequisites.</li>
        <li>Master: It is likely that the methods from [1] can be generalized to pp-interpretations, pp-constructions and that similar results can be obtained for CSPs with more elements.</li></ul>

    <h2 id="promise-csps">Promise Constraint Satisfaction</h2>
        
        <p>A <em>promise</em> CSP is parameterized by two structures $\mathbb A$ and $\mathbb B$ such that there exists a homomorphism from $\mathbb A$ to $\mathbb B$.<br />
        The PCSP of the pair $(\mathbb A,\mathbb B)$ takes as input a structure $\mathbb X$ and asks to distinguish between two cases:</p>
            <ul>
        <li>Yes: there exists a homomorphism $\mathbb X\to\mathbb A$</li>
        <li>No: there does not exist a homomorphism $\mathbb X\to\mathbb B$</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        Note that it cannot be the case that $\mathbb X$ satisfies both Yes and No; and we are <em>promised</em> that it satisfies at least one of them, hence the name. For example the PCSP of the pair $(\mathbb K_3,\mathbb K_{17})$ asks to determine whether a given graph is $3$-colorable, or not even $17$-colorable. The complexity of this problem is unknown! Therefore, no dichotomy like the Bulatov-Zhuk dichotomy is known for PCSPs.
        </p>
        
        <p>The same algebraic tools used for traditional CSPs can be used for PCSPs, in particular a notion of <em>polymorphism</em> exists that characterize the complexity of the problems.</p>
        
        <h3>Goals</h3>
        <p>Depending on the level of the student, the goal can be one of the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Read some recent articles and write a thesis about the state-of-the-art,</li>
            <li>Study the polymorphisms of templates of the form $(\mathbb C_{2n+1},\mathbb K_4)$ where $n\geq 1$ (the case $(\mathbb C_{2n+1},\mathbb K_3)$ is done in Reference [2]). For this, computer experiments can be performed.</li>

    <div class="topic" id="minion-width-desc">
    <h2 id="minion-width">A minion of graphs</h2>
        
    <p>An <em>$n$-marked graph</em> is a graph $G=(V,E)$ such that $n$ of its vertices are labelled by the numbers $1$ to $n$.
    Given two $n$-marked graphs $G$ and $H$, one defines $G\oplus H$ to be the graph obtained by taking the disjoint union of the graphs and
    gluing the vertices according to their labels.

    If $G$ is $n$-marked and $\sigma\colon\{1,\dots,n\}\to\{1,\dots,m\}$, one can define $G^\sigma$ to be the $m$-marked graph obtained by gluing the vertices of $G$ according to $\sigma$; if some $i\in\{1,\dots,m\}$ is not in the image of $\sigma$, we simply introduce in $G^\sigma$ a vertex labelled $i$ that is not connected to any other vertex.
    This way, the set of finite marked graphs forms a <em>minion</em> (something behaving similarly to Pol($\mathbb A$)), whose elements of "arity" $n$ are the $n$-marked graphs.</p>
        
    <p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_decomposition">tree decomposition</a> of a graph $G$ is a tree whose vertices are <em>bags</em> of vertices from $G$ and satisfying certain conditions. The width of the tree decomposition is the maximal size of a bag minus 1, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treewidth">treewidth</a> of $G$, denoted by $tw(G)$, is the smallest width of a tree decomposition of $G$. The treewidth of $G$ measures how "tree-like" $G$ is: trees have treewidth 1, while the clique on $n$ vertices has treewidth $n-1$.</p>
        
    <p>Fix a number $k$. For every $n\geq 1$, define an equivalence relation $\sim_n$ on $n$-marked graphs as follows: $\mathbb G\sim_n\mathbb G'$ iff for every $n$-marked graph $\mathbb H$, we have that $tw(G\oplus H)\leq k \Longleftrightarrow tw(G'\oplus H)\leq k$. The relation $\sim_n$ has finitely many equivalence classes, for all $n$.
    </p>
        
    <h3>Goals</h3>
    <p>
    Investigate the following questions:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Is it true that if $G\sim_n H$, and $\sigma\colon\{1,\dots,n\}\to\{1,\dots,m\}$ is an arbitrary function, then $G^\sigma\sim_m H^\sigma$?</li>
        <li>If so, then one can define a minion whose elements of arity $n$ are the <em>equivalence classes of $\sim_n$</em>. Since $\sim_n$ has finitely many equivalence classes, this is a locally finite minion. Investigate the relationship between this minion and other minions known in the theory of PCSPs.</li></ul>

        <div class="topic" id="smooth-apps-desc">
    <h2 id="smooth-apps">Infinite-domain constraint satisfaction</h2>
    
    <p>By allowing the domain of the constraint language of a CSP to have an infinite domain, the associated class of problems captures <em>all</em> decision problems!
    Looking for an extension of the Bulatov-Zhuk result to infinite-domain CSPs is therefore too ambitious in general, but one can restrict the class of constraint languages to so-called reducts of finitely bounded homogeneous structures.
    The Bodirsky-Pinsker conjecture states that this class of CSPs also admits a P/NP-complete dichotomy, where this time the border between tractable and intractable problems is conjectured to be characterized by algebraic and topological conditions.

    Recently, a new theory has been proposed by Mottet and Pinsker to approach this conjecture.
    This theory relies on a new tool, called <em>smooth approximations</em>, with which one could provide unified proofs of all known results involving the Bodirsky-Pinsker conjecture.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Goals</h3>
        <p>
    The goal of the internship is to develop the theory of smooth approximations to be able to overcome its current limitations. In particular, this internship will involve a mix of algorithmic, Ramsey theory, universal algebra, and model theory.</p>
