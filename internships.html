      <h2>Constraint satisfaction problems over finite structures</h2>
        <p style="margin: 50px 100px 50px 50px; text-align:justify;">
          Constraint satisfaction problems are decision problems of the form "Given a set of variables, a set, and constraints over the variables, does there exist a map from the variables to the domain that satisfies all the constraints?"
          Such problems are parameterized by the set of constraints that are allowed in the input, called the <em>constraint language</em>.
          For constraint languages consisting of relations on a finite set, the complexity of problems has been completely characterized by a celebrated recent result by Bulatov and Zhuk: every CSP is either in P or NP-complete, and the border between the two cases can be characterized algebraically using tools from the theory of universal algebra.

          Recently, some extension was proposed by Barto, DeMeo, and Mottet, where constraint languages with relations and operations were considered.
          A similar dichotomy P vs. NP-complete result was obtained for constraints over a two-element set, but the problem for general finite sets remains wide open.
          The goal of the internship is to develop the existing method and prove complexity dichotomies for larger classes of constraint languages, in particular in the 3-element case.

          The tools that will be employed are mathematical in nature, leveraging the theory of universal algebras.
