      <h2>Constraint satisfaction problems over finite structures</h2>
        <p>
          Constraint satisfaction problems are decision problems of the form "Given a set of variables, a set, and constraints over the variables, does there exist a map from the variables to the domain that satisfies all the constraints?"
          Such problems are parameterized by the set of constraints that are allowed in the input, called the <em>constraint language</em>.
          For constraint languages consisting of relations on a finite set, the complexity of problems has been completely characterized by a celebrated recent result by Bulatov and Zhuk: every CSP is either in P or NP-complete, and the border between the two cases can be characterized algebraically using tools from the theory of universal algebra.

          Recently, some extension was proposed by Barto, DeMeo, and Mottet, where constraint languages with relations and operations were considered.
          A similar dichotomy P vs. NP-complete result was obtained for constraints over a two-element set, but the problem for general finite sets remains wide open.
          The goal of the internship is to develop the existing methods and prove complexity dichotomies for larger classes of constraint languages, in particular in the 3-element case.

          The tools that will be employed are mathematical in nature, leveraging the theory of universal algebras.

    <h2>The theory of smooth approximations in infinite-domain constraint satisfaction</h2>
    <p>Constraint satisfaction problems are decision problems of the form "Given a set of variables, a set, and constraints over the variables, does there exist a map from the variables to the domain that satisfies all the constraints?"
    Such problems are parameterized by the set of constraints that are allowed in the input, called the <em>constraint language</em>.
    For constraint languages consisting of relations on a finite set, the complexity of problems has been completely characterized by a celebrated recent result by Bulatov and Zhuk: every CSP is either in P or NP-complete, and the border between the two cases can be characterized algebraically using tools from the theory of universal algebra.

    By allowing the domain of the constraint language to have an infinite domain, the associated class of problems captures <em>all</em> decision problems!
    Looking for an extension of the Bulatov-Zhuk result to infinite-domain CSPs is therefore too ambitious in general, but one can restrict the class of constraint languages to so-called reducts of finitely bounded homogeneous structures.
    The Bodirsky-Pinsker conjecture states that this class of CSPs also admits a P/NP-complete dichotomy, where this time the border between tractable and intractable problems is conjectured to be characterized by algebraic and topological conditions.

    Recently, a new theory has been proposed by Mottet and Pinsker to approach this conjecture.
    This theory relies on a new tool, called <em>smooth approximations</em>, with which one could provide unified proofs of all known results involving the Bodirsky-Pinsker conjecture.
    The goal of the internship is to develop the theory of smooth approximations to be able to overcome its current limitations. In particular, this internship will involve a mix of algorithmic, Ramsey theory, universal algebra, and model theory.</p>
